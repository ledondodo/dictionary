# Dictionary
Dictionary in terminal command line

## Launch the program
Launch the program with python by typing `python dictionary.py` in the program directory from the Terminal command line.

I personally use a shortcut with the short keyword `dict` that launches the code from the right directory.

## How does it work ?

## Libraries
This program uses MultiDictionary package.
